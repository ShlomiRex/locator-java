Future Features
==================
* Allow Right Clicking on JList in SearchWindow to allow copy file path
* In search result window, in JTextPane, allow line wrapping (so you don't have to scroll horizontally for long lines)  

Personal Comments
==================
* Think about searching a directory - while splitting the search job to multiple threads (not N threads (where N is the number of total files in a directory), but 4 or 8.)
* In Producer thread, fix CaseSensitive checks for filename and file's contents,
so that the case sensitive check in while loop will be outside of the loop, and 
for the Filename, u can remove duplicate code
* In producer thread, while scanning file's contents, u can open new thread just for reading. May be
very fast!
